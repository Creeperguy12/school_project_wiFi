        <h3> What is wiFi?</h3>
        <p>wiFi is a facility allowing devices to connect to the internet or communicate with others wirelessly in another area. It is WLAN (wireless local area network). It is essentially a wireless Ethernet.</p>

        <h3> Why is wiFi important? </h3>
        <p>We need wiFi because otherwise we would require a lot of Ethernet ports everywhere, and for a school, event or workplace this would be impractical, and this would also be expenisve. The solution is to use wiFi.

            <h3>Who invented wiFi and when? </h3>
            <p> Invented in 3rd Industrial Revolution 
There was no specific inventor for wiFi. However, Dr John O'Sullivan and his colleagues Terence Percival, Graham Daniels, Diet Ostry and John Deane developed a key patent in wiFi. They are credited with the invention of wiFi.

           <h3> Basic Info about wiFi </h3>
           <p> Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.

            <h3> The Technical Stuffs </h3>
            <p>But most importantly, Wi-Fi currently carries more than 60% of the world’s Internet traffic. Interestingly enough, this great achievement is basically done with radio waves, though it’s a little more complicated than your car stereo. Unlike the FM receiver in your car, Wi-Fi is essentially two radios communicating back and forth that use lower power and broadcast over a much shorter distance. These two radios let web users download data from the Internet as well as upload information — even just submitting addresses via your browser counts in this two-way communication.

            <h3> wiFi, for the better or the worse? </h3>
            <p> Personally, I think wiFi is for the better. It has saved the world kilometers of ethernet cables and has helped schools, workplaces and events. It is only going to advance.
